## CapiFlow

Every day in Mexico, thousands of small and medium businesses struggle to survive — not because they lack customers or sales, but because they don’t get paid on time.

The average payment term here is 60 to 120 days. That means a local supplier delivers products today and waits two or even four months to get paid.

During that time, they still have to pay salaries, rent, and raw materials — but their cash flow is frozen. Traditional banks rarely help. Credit is slow, bureaucratic, and often out of reach for smaller companies.

This liquidity gap affects more than 4 million SMEs in Mexico and represents over $100 billion dollars locked in unpaid invoices every year.

At the same time, investors are looking for alternatives to traditional savings and low-yield instruments.

So we asked ourselves — what if we could connect these two needs?

What if investors could earn solid, short-term returns, while giving SMEs the liquidity they need to keep growing?

That’s why we built CapiFlow, a fintech marketplace where SMEs can upload their verified invoices, and investors can purchase them directly.

Each invoice is validated with the Mexican tax authority and rated according to the payer’s credit risk.

Individual and private investors can then choose which invoices to fund — earning returns between 10 and 20 percent annually — while helping real businesses access cash immediately.

It’s like crowdfunding, but for invoices: SMEs get cash today; investors get stable, transparent yields tomorrow.

All transactions go through a secure trust account, or fideicomiso, ensuring total transparency and regulatory compliance.

With our technology, SMEs receive working capital in days, not months — no debt, no endless paperwork.

Investors gain access to a new, transparent asset class with predictable returns.

Together, we’re building a healthier and more inclusive financial ecosystem for Mexico and Latin America.

We don’t just fund invoices — we empower growth.
